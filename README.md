- `buffer` - For Buffer operations
- `crypto-browserify` - For cryptographic functions
- `stream-http` & `https-browserify` - For HTTP requests
- `browserify-zlib` - For compression
- `util`, `url`, `stream-browserify` - For utility functions
- `assert`, `os-browserify`, `path-browserify` - For additional Node.js modules

## Setup Instructions

### 1. MetaMask Configuration

   - Block Explorer: https://polygonscan.com

### 2. Fund Your Wallet

1. **Get USDC on Polygon:**
   - Bridge USDC from Ethereum to Polygon using [Polygon Bridge](https://wallet.polygon.technology/polygon/bridge)
   - Or buy USDC directly on Polygon using a DEX like QuickSwap

2. **Minimum Balance:**
   - Ensure you have at least $10-20 USDC for trading
   - Keep some MATIC for transaction fees
